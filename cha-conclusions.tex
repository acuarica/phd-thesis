\chapter{Conclusions}

In this proposal we have presented our research plan.
We have devised common usage patterns for the \java{} Unsafe \api.
We discussed several current and future alternatives to improve the
\java{} language.
This work has been published in~\citep{mastrangeloUseYourOwn2015}.
On the other hand, we plan to complement our Unsafe \api{} study with 
our casting study.
We are devising common usage patterns that involve the casting operator.
Having a taxonomy of usage patterns
--- for both the Unsafe \api{} and casting ---
can shed light on how \java{} developers circumvent
the static type system's constraints.

Matthias: Expand significantly. Maybe 5 pages or more. What insights did you gain, can you summarize to what degree you answered the RQs? What limitations? What future work?
