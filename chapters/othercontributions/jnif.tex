\subsection{Conclusions}

Until now, full-coverage dynamic instrumentation in production JVMs required performing the code rewriting in a separate JVM, 
because of the lack of a native bytecode rewriting framework.
This paper introduces JNIF, the first full-coverage in-process dynamic instrumentation framework for Java.
It discusses the key issues of creating such a framework for Java---such as stack-map generation---and
it evaluates the performance of JNIF against the most prevalent Java-level framework: ASM.
We find that JNIF is faster than using out-of-process ASM in most cases.
We hope that thanks to JNIF, and this paper, a broader number of researchers and developers will
be enabled to develop native JVM agents that analyze and rewrite Java bytecode without limitations.
