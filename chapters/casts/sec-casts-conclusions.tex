\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:casts:conclusions}

Many of the patterns we found should be unsurprising to most object-oriented programmers.
That nearly 45\% of casts are (possibly) unguarded 
suggests that developers use application-specific knowledge that cannot be easily encoded in
the type system to ensure the absence of run-time type errors.

Our study provides insight on the boundary between static and dynamic typing, which may inform
research on both static and dynamic, as well as gradual type systems~\cite{Siek06gradualtyping}.
Conversely, this research can inform the design of extensions of the \java{} type system to reduce the need for casting.

We are currently working to define static analyses to detect some of these patterns automatically.
With these analyses,
tools can be developed to identify instances of the pattern and to ensure that they are being implemented properly.
