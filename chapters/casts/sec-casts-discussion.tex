% The column on the right corresponds to the group the pattern belongs to.
% In this section we present the cast usage patterns we found.
% To ease the patterns presentation,
% we have organized them into ngroup{} categories according to their purpose.
Table~\ref{table:casts:categories} 
The table consists of the following columns: The \gh{Pattern} column indicates the name of the pattern.
\gh{Guarded?} The patterns in this category are guarded casts.
A guarded cast is a cast such that before the cast is applied,
some condition --- the \emph{guard} -- needs to be verified.
The condition to be verified guarantees that the cast will not fail at runtime (unless there is a bug in the application), \ie,
the cast will not throw a \code{ClassCastException}.
Some kind of guards ensure that the cast will not fail at the language-level,
while others only can guarantee it at the application-level.
\gh{Lang} These casts could be removed if there is enough language support.
\gh{Tool} The casts in this group could be checked with new analysis tools.
\gh{Dev} These casts can be avoidable with no or little refactoring,
or suggest a code smell in the source code.
