\begin{pattern}{PatternMatching}
This pattern is composed of a guard (\code{instanceof}) followed by a
cast on known subtypes of the static type.
Often there is just one case and the default case, \ie,
\code{instanceof} fails, does a no-op or reports an error.
Another common approach is to have several cases,
usually one \emph{per} subtype.

\instances{}
The following listing shows an example of the \thisp{} pattern.%
\footnote{\url{http://bit.ly/2FzYYHq}}
In this example, there is only one case

\begin{minted}[highlightlines=3]{java}
Item item = helmet.getItem();
if (item instanceof ItemImaginationGlasses)
	return ((ItemImaginationGlasses)item).checkBlock(what, helmet, this);
\end{minted}

\detection{}
To detect this pattern, we look

\discussion{}
The \thisp{} pattern can be seen as an \adhoc{}
alternative to pattern matching.
This construct can be seen in several other languages, \eg,
\haskell{}, \scala{}, and \cs{}.
There is an ongoing proposal%
\footnote{\url{http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305}} to add pattern
matching to the \java{} language.

As a workaround, alternatives to the \thisp{} pattern can be the
visitor pattern or polymorphism.
But in some cases, the chain of \code{instanceof}s is of boxed types.
Thus no polymorphism can be used.

% Maybe this should be called properly instanceof-guarded cast, to be more specific.
% This pattern checks whether a parameter in an overridden method has a more specific type.
% A cast to a variable guarded by an \code{instanceof}.
% A variable is \emph{guarded} by a condition when the condition controls
% that access to the variable, and there is no assignment after the
% condition and before the access to that variable.

The \thisp{} pattern consists of testing the runtime type of a variable against several related types.
Based on rule taken from:
It was taken from a \lgtm{} rule\footnote{\url{https://lgtm.com/rules/910065/}}.

It is a technique that allows a developer to take different actions according to the runtime type of an object.
Depending on the --- runtime --- type of an object, different cases, usually one for each type will follow.
