\begin{pattern}{Factory}
Creates an object based on some arguments either to the method call or
constructor.
Since the arguments are known at compile-time, cast to the specific type.

Cast factory method result to subtype (special case of family polymorphism).
Usually Logger.getLogger.

The method is declared to return URLConnection but can return a more specific type based on the URL string.
Cast to that.
We should generalize this pattern.

This pattern is like a "parser" pattern.
