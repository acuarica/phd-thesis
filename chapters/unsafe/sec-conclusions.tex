\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\smu{} is an API that was designed for limited use in system-level runtime library code.
The \unsafe{} API is powerful, but dangerous.
The improper use of \unsafe{} undermines \java{}'s safety guarantees.
We studied to what degree \unsafe{} usage has spread into third-party libraries,
to what degree such third-party usage of \unsafe{} can impact existing Java code,
and which \unsafe{} API features such third-party libraries actually use.
We studied the questions and discussions developers have about \unsafe{},
and we identified common usage patterns.
We thereby provided a basis for evolving the \unsafe{} API, the \java{} language, and the \jvm{}
by eliminating unused or abused unsafe features,
and by providing safer alternatives for features that are used in meaningful ways.
We hope this will help to make \unsafe{} safer.
