\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:unsafe:conclusions}

\smu{} is an \api{} that was designed for limited use in system-level runtime library code.
The \unsafe{} \api{} is powerful, but dangerous.
The improper use of \unsafe{} undermines \java{}'s safety guarantees.
We studied to what degree \unsafe{} usage has spread into third-party libraries,
to what degree such third-party usage of \unsafe{} can impact existing \java{} code,
and which \unsafe{} \api{} features such third-party libraries actually use.

We thereby provided a basis for evolving the \unsafe{} \api{}, the \java{} language,
and the \jvm{} by eliminating unused or abused unsafe features,
and by providing safer alternatives for features that are used in meaningful ways.
We hope this will help to make \unsafe{} safer.
