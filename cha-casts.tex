\chapter{Empirical Study on the Cast Operator}
\label{cha:casts}

A common mechanism for relaxing the static typing constraints in object-oriented languages is \emph{casting}.
In programming languages with subtyping---or \emph{subtype polymorphism}~\citep{cardelliUnderstandingTypesData1985}---such as \java{}, \csharp{} or \cpp{},
casting allows an expression to be viewed at a different type than the one at which it was defined.
Casts are checked dynamically, \ie{}, at run time, to ensure that the object
being cast is an instance of the desired type.

We aim to understand why developers use casts.
Why is the static type system insufficient,
requiring an escape hatch into dynamic type checking?
Specifically, we attempt to answer the following three research questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=$RQ/C\arabic*:$,ref=$RQ/C\arabic*$,leftmargin=3.4\parindent]
\item\label{casts:rq1}{\bf \crqA} \crqAdesc{}
\item\label{casts:rq2}{\bf \crqB} \crqBdesc{}
\item\label{casts:rq3}{\bf \crqC} \crqCdesc{}
\end{enumerate}

To answer these research questions, we devise
\emph{usage patterns}.
Usage patterns are \emph{recurrent programming idioms} used by developers to solve a specific issue.
Usage patterns enable the categorization of different kinds of cast usages and
thus provide insights into how the language is being used by developers in real-world applications.
Our cast usage patterns can be:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item a reference for current and future language designers
to make more informed decisions about programming languages,
\eg{},
the addition of \emph{smart casts} in \lang{Kotlin},\footnote{\url{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/typecasts.html\#smart-casts}}
\item a reference for tool builders, \eg{}, by providing more precise or new
  refactoring or code smell analyses,
\item a guide for researchers to test new language features, \eg{},~\cite{wintherGuardedTypePromotion2011} or to carry out controlled
  experiments about programming, \eg{},~\cite{stuchlikStaticVsDynamic2011}, and
\item a guide for developers for best or better practices.
\end{inparaenum}
To answer our research questions,
we empirically study how casts are used by developers.
The results of this study have been submitted for publication to \conf{OOPSLA}{19}.


\section*{Outline}

Section~\ref{sec:casts:background} provides an introduction to casts in \java{},
while Section~\ref{sec:casts:issues} illustrates the sort of problems developers have when applying casting conversions.
In Section~\ref{sec:casts:methodology} we introduce the methodology we used to analyse casts and to devise cast usage patterns.
Sections~\ref{sec:casts:overview} and~\ref{sec:casts:patterns} present the cast usage patterns and answers our research questions.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:casts:discussion} discusses the patterns we found,
while Section~\ref{sec:casts:conclusions} concludes.
