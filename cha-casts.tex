\chapter{Cast Operations in the Wild}
\label{cha:casts}

Cast operations provide a mechanism to escape the constraints of the static type system.
\emph{But do they pose a problem for developers?}
Several studies~\citep{kechagiaUndocumentedUncheckedExceptions2014,coelhoUnveilingExceptionHandling2015,zhitnitskyTop10Exception2016}
suggest that in \java{}, the \code{ClassCastException} is in the top 10 of exceptions being thrown when analysing stack traces.

To illustrate the sort of problems developers have when applying casting conversions, we performed a simple search for commits and issues including the term \code{ClassCastException} on \github{} within projects marked as using the \java{} language.
The search returned about 171K%
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/search?l=Java&q=ClassCastException&type=Commits}}
and 73K%
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/search?l=Java&q=ClassCastException&type=Issues}}
results respectively at the time of this writing.
At first glance, these results indicate that indeed \code{ClassCastException} represents a source for problems to developers.
