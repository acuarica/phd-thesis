\label{cha:casts}

Cast operations provide a mechanism to escape the constraints of the static type system.
\emph{But do they pose a problem for developers?}
Several studies~\citep{kechagiaUndocumentedUncheckedExceptions2014,coelhoUnveilingExceptionHandling2015,zhitnitskyTop10Exception2016}
suggest that in \java{},
%

the \code{ClassCastException} is in the top 10 of exceptions being thrown when analysing stack traces.

To illustrate the sort of problems developers have when applying casting conversions,

we performed a simple search for commits and issues including the term \code{ClassCastException} within projects marked as using the \java{} language on \github{}.
We have used \github{} since is the largest host of source code in the world~\citep{gousiosLeanGHTorrentGitHub2014}.
The searches returned about 171K commits%
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/search?l=Java&q=ClassCastException&type=Commits}}
and 73K issues%

results respectively at the time of this writing.
At first glance, these results indicate that \code{ClassCastException} indeed represents a source for problems to developers.
