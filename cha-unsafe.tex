\chapter{The \java{} Unsafe \api{} in the Wild}
\label{cha:unsafe}

The \java{} Virtual Machine (\jvm{}) executes \java{} bytecode and
provides other services for programs written in
many programming languages, including \java{}, \scala{}, and \clojure{}.
The \jvm{} was designed to provide strong safety guarantees.
However, many widely used \jvm{} implementations expose an \api{} that
allows the developer to access low-level,
unsafe features of the \jvm{} and underlying hardware,
features that are unavailable in safe \java{} bytecode.
This \api{} is provided through an undocumented%
\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-sun-packages-142232.html}}
class, \smu{}, in the \java{} reference implementation produced by Oracle.

Other virtual machines provide similar functionality.
For example, the \csharp{} language provides an \code{unsafe} construct
on the .NET platform,%
\footnote{\url{https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/en-en/library/chfa2zb8(v=vs.90).aspx}}
and \racket{} provides unsafe operations.%
\footnote{\url{http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/unsafe.html}}

The operations \smu{} provides can be dangerous,
as they allow developers to circumvent the safety guarantees provided by
the \java{} language and the \jvm{}.
If misused, the consequences can be resource leaks, deadlocks,
data corruption, and even \jvm{} crashes.%

We believe that \smu{} was introduced to provide better performance and
more capabilities to the writers of the \java{} runtime library.
However, \smu{} is increasingly being used in third-party
frameworks and libraries.
Application developers who rely on \java{}'s safety guarantees have to
trust the implementers of the language runtime environment
(including the core runtime libraries).
Thus the use of \smu{} in the runtime libraries is no more risky than
the use of an unsafe language to implement the \jvm{}.
However, the fact that more and more ``normal'' libraries are using
\smu{} means that application developers have to trust a growing
community of third-party \java{} library developers to not
inadvertently tamper with the fragile internal state of the \jvm{}.

Given that the benefits of safe languages are well known,
and the risks of unsafe languages are obvious,
why exactly does one need unsafe features in third-party libraries?
Are those features used in real-world code?
If yes, how are they used, and what are they used for?
More precisely, we want to answer the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=$RQ/U\arabic*:$,ref=$RQ/U\arabic*$,leftmargin=3.4\parindent]
\item\label{unsafe:rq1} {\bf \urqA} \urqAdesc{}
\item\label{unsafe:rq2} {\bf \urqB} \urqBdesc{}
\end{enumerate}

We studied a large repository of \java{} code, \mavencentral{},
to answer these questions.
We have analyzed \statreposize{} of compiled \java{} code,
spread over \statrepouniquearts{} \java{} archives,
to determine how \java{}'s unsafe capabilities are used in real-world
libraries and applications.
We found that $25\%$ of \java{} bytecode archives depend on unsafe
third-party \java{} code, and thus \java{}'s safety
guarantees cannot be trusted.
We identify $14$ different usage patterns of \java{}'s unsafe capabilities,
and we provide supporting evidence for why real-world code needs these capabilities.
Our long-term goal is to provide a strong foundation
to make informed decisions in the future evolution of the \java{} language and virtual machine,
and for the design of new language features to regain safety in \java{}.

We have already published our work on how developers use the Unsafe \api{} in \java{}~\citep{mastrangeloUseYourOwn2015}.
In this thesis we outline the risks of using the \unsafe{} \api{} in Section~\ref{sec:unsafe:background}.
Then we answer \ref{unsafe:rq1} in Section~\ref{sec:unsafe:overview}.
To answer \ref{unsafe:rq2}, first we introduce our methodology and the patterns we found in Sections~\ref{sec:unsafe:methodology} and \ref{sec:unsafe:patterns} respectively, to then present how the patterns we found could be implemented in a safer way in Section~\ref{sec:unsafe:discussion}.
