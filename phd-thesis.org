N = Total number of casts to analyze: 9,030,852
K = Total number of casts of the least used pattern
n = Sample size to select

** TODO Address completely Antonio's & Gabriele's comments on the proposal
** TODO Address Antonio's comment on casting is not circumventing the static type system
*** Dynamically recovery information
** TODO Address internal committee comments on the proposal
*** Antonio's
**** My first and perhaps most important objections are on the premise of
the main research questions, namely that casting and unsafe are
mechanism used to circumvent the type system.
**** In particular, I would argue that a down-cast is not a way to
circumvent the type system, but rather a perfectly clear and
straightforward way to work /within/ the type system.
**** The /Unsafe/ mechanism can do a lot more than messing around with types,
so I wonder in what way the use of /Unsafe/ can be
characterized as a way to circumvent the type system.
Of the 14 usage patterns listed in Table 3.1, only two have something to do with the
type system, namely throwing undeclared exceptions and updating
/final/ fields -- and those don't seem to be significant breaches of
the type systems anyway.
**** The examples listed in Section 4.1 don't seem to indicate problems with
the type system.
In other words, here ClassCast exceptions
not fundamentally different from, say, NullPointer exceptions.
**** The percentage of /indirect/ use of /Unsafe/ is not am indication of
the prevalence of bugs, let alone the prevalence of bugs that are
actually due to the use of /Unsafe/.
Perhaps you should look into that.
**** It seems to me that you are focusing on a syntactic or anyway
low-level aspect of the use of a programming language.
You should instead focus on the /semantics/ of a particular use of
a language feature.
For example, you could ask, how often and in what cases do
programmers use bound checks (in using arrays), and are those bad,
perhaps because they make the code less readable, or they are
unnecessary, because the checks are provably unnecessary.
**** You say that performance is the main motivation for the uses of Unsafe.
I would argue that the main motivation is instead another typical one:
supporting various forms of application instrumentation or
other application-independent services (e.g., a checkpointing library).
**** DONE You say you focus on high-impact uses/features,
CLOSED: [2019-04-29 Mon 15:06]
but you seem to only use static analysis.
Have you thought about measuring how often
/Unsafe/ is actually used, meaning /dynamically/? 
Another, perhaps more interesting question is how often those uses are
identified as the root cause of failures.

*** ONHOLD Gabriele's
**** Chapter 3, only 1% of the projects (817 out of 86k) use the Unsafe API,
but they use it a lot (48k usages). Why?
**** Is the usage of the Unsafe API a form of technical debt?
If yes, do you expect developers to refactor the code using the Usafe API?
**** DONE Comment on the limitation of the study in Chapter 3
CLOSED: [2019-04-29 Mon 14:28]
related to the selection of the subject systems (libraries only)
**** DONE Clarify the manual process used to define the taxonomy in Chapter 3
CLOSED: [2019-04-29 Mon 09:59]
(e.g., what is the confidence level/interval of the manually analyzed sample?
how many evaluators have been involved in the process?
how did you solve conflicts between evaluators? etc.)
**** It would be interesting to look not only to commits fixing a ClassCastException,
but also in code review repositories/issue trackers to analyze the developers’
discussion and extract the rationale behind some implementation choices.
**** Consider using the explicit link existing in GitHub between commits and issues
to only analyze bug-fixing commits related to ClassCastException
(and automatically exclude commits unrelated to bug-fixing activities).
**** Look at the 2019 MSR challenge dataset.
It reports discussions on Stack Overflow including their code snippets linked to projects in GitHub.
You can see whether a given code snippet in SO has been reused in GitHub projects and
this can give you some hints on why developers use the Unsafe API or some type cast patterns.

** DONE Literature Review: Add to introduction
CLOSED: [2019-04-27 Sat 15:04]
Users/Compilers Java/Scala generated bytecode

But there is more than empirical studies at the source code level.
A machine instruction set is effectively another kind of language.
Therefore, its design can be affected by how compilers generate machine code.
Several studies targeted the \jvm{}~\cite{collberg_empirical_2007,odonoghue_bigram_2002,antonioli_analysis_1998};
while~\cite{cook_empirical_1989} did a similar study for \lilith{} in the past.
